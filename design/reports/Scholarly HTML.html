        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The Remote Mobile Assistant application was designed in order to provide a for the user a way to monitorize the activity of one or more persons. Using the information requested from the person’s device, the user can obtain a clear view of the location, health state and also the environmental conditions from the current place of the person.
        </p>

      <section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" id="motivation">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          We designed and implemented this application in order to take advantage of the capabilities 
          of a device and to create a new form of communicating data between severeal users. In this manner
          we bring closer the persons that need more attention to the persons that are interested in giving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our high-level goals are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To provide to the users valuable information about persons they care about
          </li>
          <li>
            To explore the devices limits and to make use of their capabilities
          </li>
          <li>
            To simulate a remote assistant, capable of gathering information about the person that he has 'in care'
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section typeof="sa:Target audience" id="target">
        <h2>Target audience</h2>
        <p>
         To better understand the behaviour that an user may have regarding the application, we created four 
         different personas and we described the way they may interact with it. 
         <p>We choosed a primary persona in order to identify the profile of an ideal user, his needs and his expectations.
         </p>
         <p>The negative persona helped us pay a closer attention to the security part.</p>
         <p>The customer persona's puropose was to validate the success of the application regarding the financial part; in othe words if it has chances to be selled to an acceptable number of people.</p> 
         <p>We used the served person profile in order to observe the effects that the application may have on the device possessor.</p>
      </section>

       <section typeof="sa:Solution" id="solution">
        <h2>The implementation of the solution</h2>
        <p>The main purpose of the application is allow people that can't be all the time with a certain person to 
        never lost the connection with them and to permanently be aware of their curent state.</p>
        <p>To achive this goal we created a way to connect the device to an user account and to allow access 
        to the phone's sensors in order to extract information about the environment conditions, location and even health state. Furthermore, we also enabled some remote calls that can change the device features like 
        luminosity and sound volume.</p>
        <p>In order to make it accessible for people with special needs, we created a section for the customization 
        of the account, where the user can adjust the font-size, the contrast and the theme, in order not to cause them side reactions when interacting with the application.</p>
        <p>The project, split into two parts (mobile and web - the served one and the one that supervises),
        is adressed to all the people that have someone in their care and have a basic knowledge of PC usage. On the other hand, the person that takes benefits from the application is the owner of the device. Whether the recipient is a child, a person with special needs or even an animal that can have attached a mobile device, it gets in a safe zone where there is always somebody that keeps an eye on him.</p>

      <section typeof="sa:Conclusion" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Te Remote Mobile Assistant is an application of real help in gathering information from the environment
          via a device and transmitting them to an web account. When implementing the project we took into consideration the user needs, their capabilities and how they could deal with the data received and that's how we achieved an easy, smart and realiable tool for monitoring the user's most important persons.
