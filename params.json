This user specific data is often processed in conjunction to different environmental data, usually modeled via rules – for example, increasing/decreasing the screen brightness depends on the sunlight or go to voicemail if it is too cold to get the phone out. In addition, other significant data could be considered: pollution, various natural hazards like earthquakes, and others. Propose a multi-device UI framework/application that takes advantage of both user preferences (including anatomical characteristics, psychological profile, or health status), context (place or season) and/or device (TV, mobile device, home appliance, smart car), etc.\r\n\r\n### Technical requirements\r\n* Minimum 3 ideas/concepts regarding the project design (including the sketches, wireframes, storyboards and, eventually, prototypes), plus the intermediary stages of the project development. Also, the team should provide the documentation regarding interaction design patterns used in the wireframes/prototypes.\r\n* Minimum 3 real examples concerning the QOC method. These examples could also give the motivation for choosing a certain idea/concept.\r\n* The 4 mandatory HTML5 persona documents.\r\n* The project identity and the most significant details regarding the branding process.\r\n* A public blog, wiki and/or personal Web site recording the project progress. The use of GitHub platform is highly encouraged.\r\n\r\n###

Design patterns\r\nGetting Input Design Patterns\r\n==============================\r\n1. Account Registration\r\n------------------------------\r\nUsed when you wish to know who the active user is in order to provide personalized content.\r\n\r\nIn order to access our featured from the application, the user needs to register and create an account. There are different methods of registration: using the regular form or using a 3rd party provider like facebook or twitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Input Feedback\r\n------------------------------\r\nUsed when the user has entered data into the system and expects to receive feedback on the result of that submission.\r\n\r\nAll the actions taken by the user will receive feedback via toast messages or input validation messages.\r\n\r\n\r\nNavigation Design Patterns\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n1. Home Link\r\n------------------------------\r\nUsed when users frequently enter the website through a page other than the home page. The user needs to be able to easily navigate to the starting point or front page of the website.\r\n\r\nThere is a link to the starting point or front page of the website on the site’s logo on every single page on the website. This is placed in the header of the website.\r\n\r\n2. Breadcrumbs\r\n------------------------------\r\nUsed when the user needs to know their location in the website's hierarchical structure in order to possibly browse back to a higher level in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIn first version of the desing, there are Breadcrumbs links that will show exactly to the user where he is at any momment in the page. This is usefull when he want to navigate one step back in the aplication. The disadvantage of this step is that it does not offer any clue regarding the next step.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Design Patterns\r\n==============================\r\n1. Adaptable View\r\n------------------------------\r\nUsed when you want to let the site's presentation of content fit the specific needs of the user.\r\n\r\nUse case scenarios:\r\n- used when a considerable part portion of your potential users have specific technical needs concerning how content is presented. Examples are mobile browsers, small screen resolutions, and monochrome monitors.\r\n\r\n- used when a considerable part of your potential users have specific needs to regarding accessibility and how content is presented due to disability. Examples are colour-blindness or poor vision.\r\n\r\nThe interface can be adaptable based on user preferences. He can increase/decrease the font used, change the color scheme or use a certain layout. This is done in version 3 of the application.\r\n",
